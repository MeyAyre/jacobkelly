                        Hey there! I’m Jacob Kelly, a multi-instrumentalist performer and teacher from Seattle, Washington. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        My life of music started in west Africa in Accra, Ghana when I was eleven years old and my love of music and rhythm has been 
                        unfolding ever since. Thirteen years into my life as a musician, I have years of training and experience in guitar, piano, drums and vocals.
                        This includes four years studying classical guitar with Julian Catford, and a Bachelor’s degree in Music Composition from Seattle Pacific 
                        University. I’ve also had the opportunity to tour the western half of the United States many times, playing guitar and singing in my personal 
                        projects, or playing bass or drums with adjacent music projects. It’s my passion to create meaningful music and to empower people to do the 
                        same. 
                    </p>
